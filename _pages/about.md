Hello! 

I'm a senior at Rice University studying Neuroscience, Computer Science, and Cognitive Science. 

My interests lie at the intersection of neuroscience and engineering. I am currently conducting research at the [Rice Neuroengineering Initiative](https://neuroengineering.rice.edu/) and [University of Washington Center for Neurotechnology](http://faculty.washington.edu/aorsborn/research.html). I am advised by [Dr. Jerzy Szablowski](https://www.szablowskilab.org/) and [Dr. Amy Orsborn](http://faculty.washington.edu/aorsborn/research.html). Previously, I conducted research at the [Stanford Center for Asian Health Research and Education](https://med.stanford.edu/care.html).

I have received the [Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship](https://goldwaterscholarship.gov/), [Sigma Xi Grant in Aid of Research](https://www.sigmaxi.org/programs/grants-in-aid-of-research), and am a [2021 Stanford CARE Scholar](https://med.stanford.edu/care/education/care-scholars/care-scholars-alumni.html). My work has culminated in published work in journals such as The Lancet Global Health and the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine as well as presentations at conferences such as the American Thoracic Society International Conference, Consortium of Universities for Global Health Conference, National Conference on Undergraduate Research, and the Society of General Internal Medicine.

Beyond my research work, I am the co-founder and co-president of Rice's Neurotechology Club, co-founder and Vice President of the Rice Cubing Club, an Academic Fellow for Lovett College, a Peer Academic Advisor, and a Peer Research Ambassador for Rice's [Office of Undergraduate Research and Inquiry](https://ouri.rice.edu/).

Outside of my academic endeavors, I enjoy [speedsolving Rubik's Cubes](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2019WANG86), playing soccer, cooking, and reading.

I can be reached at r (dot) wang (at) rice.edu.
