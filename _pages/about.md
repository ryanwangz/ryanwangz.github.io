Hello! 

I'm a senior at Rice University studying Neuroscience, Computer Science, and Cognitive Science. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of neuroscience and engineering. I am currently conducting research at the [Rice Neuroengineering Initiative](https://neuroengineering.rice.edu/) with [Dr. Jerzy Szablowski](https://www.szablowskilab.org/) and at the [University of Washington Center for Neurotechnology](http://faculty.washington.edu/aorsborn/research.html) with [Dr. Amy Orsborn](http://faculty.washington.edu/aorsborn/research.html). Previously, I conducted research at the [Stanford Center for Asian Health Research and Education](https://med.stanford.edu/care.html) with Drs. Lauren Eggert, Malathi Srinivasan, and Shanthi Kappagoda as a [2021 Stanford CARE Scholar](https://med.stanford.edu/care/education/care-scholars/care-scholars-alumni.html).

I have received the [Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship](https://goldwaterscholarship.gov/) and [Sigma Xi Grant in Aid of Research](https://www.sigmaxi.org/programs/grants-in-aid-of-research) for my research. My work has culminated in published work in journals such as _The Lancet Global Health_ and the _Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine_ as well as presentations at conferences such as the _American Thoracic Society International Conference_, _Consortium of Universities for Global Health Conference_, _National Conference on Undergraduate Research_, and _Society of General Internal Medicine_.

Beyond my research work, I am the co-founder and co-president of [Rice's Neurotechology Club](http://neurotech.rice.edu/), co-founder and Vice President of the Rice Cubing Club, an Academic Fellow for Lovett College, a Peer Academic Advisor, Peer Research Ambassador for Rice's [Office of Undergraduate Research and Inquiry](https://ouri.rice.edu/), and a Scientific Communication Coach with Rice's [Center for Academic and Professional Communication](https://pwc.rice.edu/center-academic-and-professional-communication).

Outside of my academic endeavors, I enjoy [speedsolving Rubik's Cubes](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2019WANG86), playing soccer, cooking, and reading.
