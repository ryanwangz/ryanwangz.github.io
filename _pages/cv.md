Research experience
======
January 2021 - present: Szablowski Lab for Noninvasive Neuroengineering
Rice Neuroengineering Initiative 
Advisors: Dr. Jerzy Szablowski, Manwal Harb

* Evaluate multiplexed neuromodulation via Acoustically Targeted Chemogenetics (ATAC) in a mouse model
  * Implement focused ultrasound for blood-brain barrier opening (FUS-BBBO) to evaluate feasibility of using ATAC in multiple areas.
* Evaluated novel method of non-invasive brain biopsy via Focused Ultrasound (FUS)
* Implemented fringe projection profilometry (FPP) to optimize focused ultrasound calibration for blood-brain barrier opening (FUS-BBBO) to improve ATAC.
  * Developed software programs for fringe projection mapping, calibration of the hardware, and data processing/visualization (MATLAB, C).
