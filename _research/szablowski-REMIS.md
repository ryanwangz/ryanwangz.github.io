Measuring gene expression is a critical diagnostic that can be used to study activity in the brain, assess the success of gene therapies, and even diagnose the onset of neural disease. Doing so both non-invasively and in a live brain presents a significant challenge that could be applied to a range of clinical and scientific uses.

Using synthetic markers of gene expression and focused ultrasound for blood-brain barrier opening (FUS-BBBO), we successfully developed a precise, sensitive, noninvasive paradigm for monitoring gene expression in the brain called Recovery of Markers through InSonation (REMIS).
