Acoustically Targeted Chemogenetics is a method of non-invasive neuromodulation with high spatial and temporal specificity. Using focused ultrasound to induce blood-brain barrier opening (FUS-BBBO), genes carried by adeno-associated viruses can be delivered to specific cell types in the targeted area, thus achieving millimeter spatial resolution.

My project aimed to improve the calibration process during the FUS-BBBO stage using fringe projection profilometry (FPP), a widely used 3-D scanning technique based on structured illumination. Compared to current methods for calibration, this method is more non-invasive, automated, rapid, spatially accurate, and affordable. I developed the software for the project, primarily in Matlab. We ultimately did not succeed in integrating our system into the existing commercial hardware.
