excerpt: 'Little is known about vaccination rates among disaggregated Asian-American (AA) subgroups. Using the National Health Interview Survey, we analyzed recent vaccination rates (2015-2018, n=188,250) and trends (2006-2018) among Chinese, Asian Indian, Filipino, other Asian, and non-Hispanic White (NHW) adults for six vaccines (Human Papillomavirus, hepatitis B, pneumococcal, influenza, tetanus-diphtheria, and shingles vaccines). This project aimed to help inform policies aimed at increasing vaccine uptake. Foreign-born AAs have lower vaccination rates than US-born AAs. AAs have lower rates in some vaccines than NHW.'
