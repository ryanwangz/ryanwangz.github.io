excerpt: 'Asian Americans (AAs) report higher rates of insufficient sleep than other groups nationally. It is unclear how sleep outcomes differ among disaggregated Asian subgroups. The National Health Interview Survey was used to analyze self-reported sleep quality and duration measures for AA subgroups to inform policies and future research. Filipinos report poor sleep outcomes and Asian Indians report significantly better sleep outcomes, highlighting the importance of disaggregating Asians.'

Asian Americans (AAs) report higher rates of insufficient sleep than other ethnicities, but sleep outcomes are not well characterized in AAs and AA subgroups. Furthermore, risk factors for sleep outcomes such as demographic, socioeconomic, health behavior, and health-related factors have not been studied extensively in AAs. In this project, the National Health Interview Survey was used to analyze self-reported sleep quality and duration measures for AA subgroups to inform policies and future research. Using logistic regression, we found Filipinos report poor sleep outcomes and Asian Indians report significantly better sleep outcomes. We confirmed a high prevalence of poor sleep outcomes among all Asian Americans, with one-third reporting insufficient sleep. However, there is significant variation in sleep outcomes among Asian ethnic subgroups. Using a subsetted logistic regression, we found several risk factors associated with sleep quality and duration Filipinos, Asian Indians, and Chinese. Most notably, among foreign-born Chinese, Asian Indians, and Filipinos, longer duration in the United States is associated with lower odds of sufficient sleep duration and quality.
