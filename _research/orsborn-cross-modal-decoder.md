Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) establish a direct link between a user's cognitive processes and computer systems, offering avenues for restoring and augmenting human capabilities. For example, BCIs have been used to restore motor function in disabled individuals, translate throughts to text, and facilitate control of a computer screen. Successful implementation hinges upon the accurate, efficient, and precise decoding of brain signals. \

At the Orsborn Lab at the University of Washington's Center for Neurotechnology, I am developing a novel neural decoder paradigm for BCIs that could expand the practicality and accessibility of BCIs.
