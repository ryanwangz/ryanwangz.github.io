Acoustically Targeted Chemogenetics is a method of non-invasive neuromodulation with high spatial and temporal specificity. Using focused ultrasound to induce blood-brain barrier opening (FUS-BBBO), genes carried by adeno-associated viruses can be delivered to specific cell types in the targeted area, thus achieving millimeter spatial resolution.

My project aims to assess whether ATAC can target and modulate multiple sites independently. If successful, we could independently modulate different nodes of neural networks to treat complex disorders.
