excerpt: 'In this paper, we examined National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data from 2015–18 to analyse the vaccination patterns, factors, and trends of Chinese, Asian Indian, Filipino, other Asian, and non-Hispanic White adults (n=253,626) for seven vaccines recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We found that Asian Americans have lower rates of some routine vaccines than non-Hispanic Whites, foreign-born Asian Americans have lower vaccination rates than their U.S.-born counterparts, and vaccination rates and trends vary significantly among Asian subgroups. Thus, culturally-targeted public health interventions may improve vaccination rates.'
