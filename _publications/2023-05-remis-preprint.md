title: "Acoustically-Targeted Measurement of Transgene Expression in the Brain"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-05-remis-preprint
excerpt: 'Gene expression is a critical component of brain physiology and activity, but monitoring this expression in the living brain represents a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a new paradigm called Recovery of Markers through InSonation (REMIS) for noninvasive measurement of gene expression in the brain with cell-type, spatial, and temporal specificity.'
