excerpt: 'In this paper, we examined National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data from 2006–2018 to analyse the sleep patterns, factors, and trends of Chinese, Asian Indian, Filipino, other Asian, and non-Hispanic White adults (n=880,210). We found that Filipinos had the worst sleep outcomes, while Asian Indians had significantly better sleep outcomes. All Asian subgroups were less likely to report using sleep medications than NHWs. Foreign-born status had a negative association with sufficient sleep duration in Filipinos but a positive association in Asian Indians and Chinese. These findings highlight the importance of disaggregating Asian ethnic subgroups to address their health needs.'
